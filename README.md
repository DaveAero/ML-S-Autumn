# Machine Learning and Statistics - Autumn 2023/2024

This repository contains the coursework for the "Machine Learning and Statistics" module, Autumn 2023/2024. The coursework is centred around the analysis of the `abalone.csv` dataset, which is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Repository Structure

- **`abalone.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the tasks and the project work for this assignment.
- **`abalone.csv`**: The dataset used throughout the analysis.
- **`.gitignore`**: A standard `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Contents

### Tasks (40% of grade)

The tasks section in the `abalone.ipynb` notebook covers the following:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading the `abalone.csv` dataset using pandas.
2. **Variable Classification**: Classification of each variable in the dataset based on common variable types and measurement scales.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Select and demonstrate appropriate summary statistics for each variable.
4. **Data Visualization**: Select and demonstrate the most suitable plots for each variable.

### Project (40% of grade)

The project focuses on applying classification algorithms to the abalone dataset:

- **Supervised Learning Overview**: Explaining supervised learning and classification algorithms.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement at least one standard classification algorithm using the scikit-learn library.
- **Analysis**: Analysis and discussion of the model's performance, supported by appropriate plots, mathematical notation, and diagrams.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run this program from the cloned root folder; the database is loaded using a file path into the data folder.

# Warning!
** The grid search is used to optimise the Nural Network searches across a vast combination of parameters. I have included the results in text format as re-running this block can take considerable time. My machine is no slouch, and it takes approximately four hours to search through combinations.
